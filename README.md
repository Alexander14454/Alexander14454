## About me 
<p>
My name is Alex and I am a programmer and graphic designer. I have been programming for years now, I started by teaching myself most of the knowlegde I know and then started to take a few college classes to expand my knowlegde further. I am currently working towards a CIS degree and hope to learn as much as a can from college whilst working on my own projects and programming ideas. Check the My skills section to get a better idea of what I have experience in.
